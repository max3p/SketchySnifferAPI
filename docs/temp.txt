Some things ive noticed while testing:

- the AI is too critical, and seems bias towards high scam score for innocent looking listings. it should be a little more relaxed. 

- it treats off-platform contacts too harshly. contact over phone is normal for kijiji, this is not a red flag. other platforms are indeed questionable, but maybe a medium severity signal. 

- it correctly identifies signals such as: 
"lacks condition details"
"pressure to act quickly" because the listing said "priced to sell"
"articificial scarcity" because the seller said its a rare find. 
but it considered these signals too harshy. 

in reality, it was a legitimate posting by a legitimate seller, but these folks often say these things to get their item sold. 
we still need to show these flags and inform the user, but the scam score should be a bit more lenient to these. 

overall, the system works, the AI is just too strict and needs to take a chill pill a bit.
